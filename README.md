## 🎯 Objective

Your mission is to uncover a **hidden Eid message** spread across three mysterious files:

- `file1.txt` – A wild mix of numbers
- `file2.txt` – Symbols dancing in madness
- `file3.txt` – A poetic riddle full of clues

You must decode the files using your brainpower, teamwork, and maybe a few lines of code.  
The first team to reveal the correct message **wins**!

## 👥 Team Structure (Mandatory)

- All participants must **pair up into teams of two**.
- Collaboration is key: one can drive the keyboard while the other navigates, and switch roles often.
- Each pair will work independently to crack the challenge.

3. 🧑‍💻 Each team must present:(DM ME) and posting done.
   - The **hidden message**
   - A summary of the **steps/scripts/logic** used
   - Any interesting observations or shortcuts

## 🏆 Victory Conditions

- 🥇 First pair to decode the correct message = **Winner**
- 🌟 Bonus points for:
  - Elegant or minimal code
  - Creative, manual solving methods
  - Good teamwork and explanation
